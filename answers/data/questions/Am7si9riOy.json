  "answers": [
    "While I appreciate many aspects of working at HigherSummit, the communication between departments could be improved. Information often gets siloed within teams, which sometimes leads to duplicate work or missed opportunities for collaboration. I believe implementing better cross-functional communication channels and regular inter-department meetings could help address this challenge.",
    "The main challenge I've encountered at HigherSummit is the somewhat unclear career progression path. While there are opportunities for advancement, the criteria for promotions and the specific steps needed to move up aren't well-defined. I think having more structured development plans and regular career discussions would be beneficial for employee retention and motivation.",
    "One challenge at HigherSummit is our somewhat outdated technology infrastructure. While we've made some improvements, many of our internal systems aren't as integrated or efficient as they could be, which impacts daily productivity. Investing in modern tools and software would help streamline our workflows and reduce time spent on manual processes.",
