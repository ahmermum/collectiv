  "answers": [
    "While I appreciate many aspects of working at HigherSummit, the communication between departments could be improved. Information often gets siloed within teams, which sometimes leads to duplicate work or missed opportunities for collaboration. I believe implementing better cross-functional communication channels and regular inter-department meetings could help address this challenge.",
    "The main challenge I've encountered at HigherSummit is the somewhat unclear career progression path. While there are opportunities for advancement, the criteria for promotions and the specific steps needed to move up aren't well-defined. I think having more structured development plans and regular career discussions would be beneficial for employee retention and motivation.",

    "One aspect that could be improved at HigherSummit is the expectation of constant availability. While I understand the nature of our global business, the frequent after-hours calls and emails can make it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Establishing clearer boundaries around working hours and implementing a more formal system for handling urgent matters would help address this concern."
