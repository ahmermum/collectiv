  "answers": [
    "I don't like the office size. Its too small. Also there are no real opportunities to socialise.",
    "While I appreciate many aspects of working at HigherSummit, the communication between departments could be improved. Information often gets siloed within teams, which sometimes leads to duplicate work or missed opportunities for collaboration. I believe implementing better cross-functional communication channels and regular inter-department meetings could help address this challenge."
